FireworksEx
===========

FireworksEx can cause a great welcoming for players that join and will allow you to create different fireworks using commands!

##Fireworks on join##

Each time a player joins the plugin will release a firework at their location. The firework can be fully customized and is optionally restricted to users that have the correct permission.

##Firework commands (todo)##

You can also spawn different fireworks using command. The firework's appearance can be customized using these variances:

   
- Shape of the firework (Creeper, Nugget, Feather, etc.)
- Color (Full RGB color spectrum)
- Color Fading (multiple colors)
- Trail (Diamond effect)
- Crackle (Glowstone dust effect)
