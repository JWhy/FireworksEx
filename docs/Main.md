FireworksEx
===========

FireworksEx can cause a great welcoming for players that join and will allow you to create different fireworks using commands!

##Features##

**Fireworks on join**:<br>
 	Each time a player joins the plugin will release a firework at their location. The firework can be fully customized and is optionally restricted to users that have the correct permission.

 **Firework commands (todo)**:<br>
	You can also spawn different fireworks using command. The firework's appearance can be customized using all styles as shown below.

**All Firework styles**:

 * Shape of the firework (Creeper, Nugget, Feather, etc.)
 * Color (Full RGB color spectrum)
 * Color Fading (multiple colors)
 * Trail (Diamond effect)
 * Crackle (Glowstone dust effect)

###Installation & Configuration###

FireworksEx is very easy to be installed:

Download latest FireworksEx.jar from [BukkitDev](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/fireworksex/files/ "BukkitDev: FireworksEx Files") or [Jenkins](http://bukkit.jwhy.de/plugins/fireworksex/.build/ "Jenkins: FireworksEx")* and move it into the "plugins" folder of your CraftBukkit installation. Once you restart or /reload the server, a configuration file will be created and the FireworksEx is ready for use.

Now you can configure FireworksEx through it's config.yml, which is located at _bukkit/plugins/FireworksEx/config.yml_. The file is annotated and includes basic information on the different settings.<br>
